# Modified Booth Multiplier or MBM (Radix-4 Booth Algorithm)


## Abstract

Adders and multipliers are fundamental components of many circuits.  
The modified Booth multiplier or MBM (radix-4 multiplier), reduces the number of partial products by 50%. This increases speed, reduces power consumption and saves space on the multiplier layout. Furthermore, the use of a Wallace tree, based on Carry Save adders, for the accumulation of the partial products and a CLA adder, used as the last stage of the Wallace tree for the final sum, ensures further improvements in area usage and performance in terms of speed and power compared to conventional multipliers.
